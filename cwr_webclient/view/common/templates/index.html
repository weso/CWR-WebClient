        <p>This is a prototype for the CWR web application.</p>

        <p>It is still under development, but several steps can be tried and tested. Mainly the CWR validation steps.
            But pay attention that not all the CWR files may be correctly read yet.</p>

        <p>Once the application is fully working it will offer several features, which include among them:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>CWR file uploading and storage</li>
            <li>CWR file validation and acknowledgement file creation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And also will allow connecting to external modules for other related jobs, such as:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Data matching</li>
            <li>Results report and manual edition</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2>Uploading files</h2>

        <p>You can try uploading a file for the CWR validation process. Remember that not all files will be read
            correctly on the current version.</p>

        <p><a class="btn btn-default" role="button" href="{{ url_for('cwr_file.upload') }}">Upload CWR files</a>
